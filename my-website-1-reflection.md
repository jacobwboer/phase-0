Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a new repository (repo), first create an account on github.com and have a good username.  Go to the upper right and click the plus sign next to your avatar and select “New Repository”.  Choose a repo name and click “create repository”.  To clone a repo to your local computer, navigate to the repo page you want and copy the URL under the “HTTPS clone URL” heading.  Next, open your Terminal and navigate to the directory you want to clone to.  Then you can type in “git clone ” and the URL.

Describe what open source means.

Open source software (sometimes called Free and Open Source Software of FOSS) is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think it is easy for me as a beginer to think it is fantastic because I have everything to learn and to gain from other people's existing work.  However, if I worked hard to create something that others found useful, I would want to benefit from it.  I don't feel nervous or protective, but I have nothing to lose at the moment.  I also am grateful and appreciative for all the open source materials available on the web and I do feel an obligation to pay it forward so everyone can benefit and improve.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Open source licenses allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared.  Businesses can use th code and extend it with their own proprietary features. This means that the original developer lets others earn money off their code, but it also lets the developer release a base product that others can contribute to while selling his own proprietary add-ons. It's a win-win.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I feel like I have experienced the baseline uses for GitHub and feel more comfortable with its interface.  I also gained more useful practice with git in the terminal.  Being able to work remotely on my home computer and sync my work with the hub to share updates and progress on a project is very exciting.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I just had to re-watch the provided instructional video about 12 times before I finally got the process down.
