4.2 Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment

What does puts do?

-- [puts] simply writes onto the screen whatever comes after it.

What is an integer? What is a float?

-- Numbers without decimal points are called integers, and numbers with decimal points are usually called floating-point numbers or, more simply, floats. Most programs use only integers. Floats are mor commonly used for academic purposes like experiments.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

-- When you do arithmetic with integers, you'll always get integer answers.  If it does not get the exact answer, it always rounds down.  The book gave a movie theater analogy to explain this.  If two people want to go see a movie and tickets are $5 each.  They can't spend $15 to see 1.5 movies each.  Only whole division and whole multiplication makes sense.

Exercises 2.5

```
puts 'Hours in a year'
puts 365 * 24
puts 'Minutes in a decade'
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
puts 'Your age in seconds'
puts 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 31

puts 'Our dear authors age'
puts 1160000000 / 365 / 24 / 60 / 60
```
