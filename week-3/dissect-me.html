    <h1>Using Git and GitHub </h1>
    <h2>The Many Benefits of Version Control</h2>
    <h4>September 11, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      Git is an open-source version control management system that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project.  Git exists locally on a personâ€™s computer.  Github is a social coding website that allows developers to share their code and keep track of their changes using Git.  It exists remotely online.

        Version control is the ability to save multiple versions of a project so that they can be reviewed or tracked.  GitHub is great because it allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time and tells you when a change was made, who made it, what they called the change, what file they changed, what they deleted and what they added to the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Developers use version control and websites like GitHub to keep track of changes in their code.  This is useful if a mistake is made or an earlier version is needed.  It is also important when a developer is working on the same files with other people.  Instead of sending a file back and forth to work on it, they can all work on the same files at the same time and merge them together.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

- We used the <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <section>, <h1>, and <p> tags.  We continue to use these tags because they are the basic structure of an HTML document.  Some are required for the page to display and the others are the most commonly used elements on the page.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

- The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications. These specifications are maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) organization, which is the standards organization for the web. The browser displays what is in the body of the document by rendering tags we use such as <section> <div> <h1> etc.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

- We learned how to make a snippet in Sublime.  It was pretty cool and I definitely see myself doing it again.  As for shortcuts, Sublime has tons.  I was watching the sublime video tutorial from the bonus material section of week 1 and there are tons.  I learned about fuzzy searching (command P) as an example.
