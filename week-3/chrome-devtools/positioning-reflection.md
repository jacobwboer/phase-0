How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

- You can format or position elements right in the browser of a webpage and see the results instantly.  Chrome's DevTools also uses the Document Object Model and allows you to visualize the elements on the page by clicking on the code editor.  This makes it easier to understand the code on a page and edit it quickly if need be.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

- On the right side of the tools you can click on Styles to view the CSS.  You can then make any sort of edits to the CSS to resice elements as needed.

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

- The first to know is Static.  All HTML elements are static by default.  A static positioned element is always in order of the normal flow of the HTML on the page.  A fixed element is stationary relative to the browser window.  They are removed from the normal flow of the document.  Relative is positioned relative to its normal positioning.  An element with Absolute is positioned relative to the first element on the page that is something other than static.  The easiest to use is static, because everything is then in order.  The most difficult is relative, because then lots can change anytime anything is changed.

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

- Padding is the space between the content of the element and its border.  Border is the space between the padding and the margin.  Margin is the space between the border and whatever elements are on the page.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

- I enjoyed this challenge.  I am very new to CSS and this kind of problems is exactly what I want to be looking at and learning through practice before I am asked to make my own website with CSS.  I am definitely getting there.
