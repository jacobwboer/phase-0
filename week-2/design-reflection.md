1) What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

Phase One: Information Gathering - consider purpose, goals, target audience, and content.
Phase Two: Planning - the point where a site map is developed with a list of all main topic areas of the site, as well as sub-topics.
Phase Three: Design - consider your target audience when choosing a design
Phase Four: Development - create the actual functioning site
Phase Five: Testing and Delivery - make sure everything works
Phase Six: Maintenance

2) What is your site’s primary goal or purpose?  What kind of content will your site features?

The primary goal of my website is to raise my profile and better market me to prospective employers and clientes.  The website's content will be about me, my professional backgroun, and the projects I have completed and am working on.


3) What is your target audience’s interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is prospective employers and potential clients.  I will list my professional background and skills and showcase my projects and work history.

4) What is the primary “action” the user should take when coming to your site?  Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio?  It’s okay to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I think searching for information, contacting me, and seeing my portfolio are all things that people should be able to do when visiting my site.

5) What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

User experience is how a person feels when interfacing with a ystem.  User experience design won't work in every situation for every user because, as human beings, we are all different.  Things to remeber: What works for one person might have the opposite effect on another. You can’t determine the effectiveness of a user experience design based solely on statistics such as page views, bounce rates and conversion rates. User experience and usability have become synonymous, but these two fields are clearly distinct. UX addresses how a user feels when using a system, while usability is about the user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface.

6) What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User design is a framework of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of a product, service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process.  It is valuable because if a user has trouble using a website or service, then they will not want to use it again.

7) Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

This challenge was not as tedious as some of the exercises from last week.  I had to several times re-upload my materials to GitHub because I was having difficulty with the pathway for the image.
