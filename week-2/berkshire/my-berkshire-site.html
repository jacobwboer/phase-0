<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I find it very humorous that Berkshire Hathaway's website is so basic that I could understand most of with only a short amount of training in HTML.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fine.  No problems.  Not sure what to add to this response.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We worked together great and did not do any styling in HTML.  We know that we have to wait for this until we learn CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems good because it is so basic.  There seems to be a couple dozen basic tags to learn and you can do almost anything with it for displaying information in a browser.  What seems bad about it is there are lots of tags and I feel like I am going to forget to close a tag sometime and it will get me stuck sometime.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Tags are pretty literal and close to their definitions.  I don't think tricks are needed, just repitition and practice to commit them to memory.
