What is a wireframe?
- A website wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.  The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the websiteâ€™s content.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
- Wireframing is important because it allows the designer to plan the layout and interaction of an interface without being distracted by colors, typeface choices or even copy.  Like the foundation of a building, making a strong wireframe is where you have to start before making smaller decisions.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
- I would have liked to have seen some examples of other people's wireframes before working on my own.  I have never done this and did not know what was really expected of me at my current level.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
- Honestly, what I made today was just to complete the assignment.  Once I see some other people's ideas I will probably feel more inspired to improve and make changes to mine.

What questions did you ask during this challenge?  What resources did you find to help you answer them?
- Once again, resources I found online to help with wireframing I felt were a little more advanced that what was needed for this assignment.  I still do not really know what is expected of us given our beginning level.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
- I understand the benefits of wireframing, and I believe in my future career I will definitely sketch stuff out on paper before committing it to code, but I'm not going to use a graphic editor to make wireframes in the future.
