# 1.1 Think About Time

This week I watched the Tedx Fremont talk about “Tiny Habits” or “Health and Habit” with BJ Fogg.  I googled him and he is a behavior scientist and professor at Stanford University.

He gave the formula of B=MAT.  Meaning that behavior has three elements: motivation, ability, and a trigger.  He asserted that people do not need to train themselves how to do something.  They need to train themselves how to make doing something automatic.  Another phrasing of this given in the talk is that people need to design for the behaviors that lead to the desired outcome, not for the outcome itself.  His method involved finding easy things to do that don’t require much motivation that can incrementally automate you to reach your goals.  He gave the example of doing several pushups after every use of the bathroom to reach fitness goals.  He also emphasized the need to celebrate small victories to positively reinforce oneself.

Timeboxing is an agreed amount of time that a person or team will work towards a goal.  Rather than extending the amount of time (if it is needed) to reach the goal, work is instead stopped and evaluated based on the amount of time taken.

Currently, I feel like I manage my time well.  I probably put more time into assignments and projects than others because I enjoy learning and challenging myself, but I also do not have a family or a job at this time.  Currently my strategy for time management work fine, because I do what I want whenever I want to for as long as is needed.  However, I am aware enough to realize this is most likely the complete opposite of what time management should be as I will have to someday balance a professional career, home, and social life.

At present, I go to work every day to my father’s office building and he has a spare desk at work that I can use.  I intend to treat Phase 0 like a normal 9-5 job.  Each week’s assignments and challenges will be my first priority for the day, and if times allows after their completion, I intend to study and explore additional coding related materials online.


## 1.2 The Command Line

What is shell? What is “bash?”

Bash is a Unix shell and command language that can be accessed through a computer’s Terminal program.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

I still would have liked to have seen more examples of Pipes and Redirection.  I think I understand the concept of piping commands, but I would like to have explored limitations or got more practice.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was able to successfully use all of the commands.  The only command that I used that didn’t give me the expected output was apropos, but in the tutorial he said he almost never uses this command anyways.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I think moving files, editing files, copying files and redirecting files will probably be the most important commands and arguments to know.  I do believe what the instructor said that once you are comfortable working in the UNIX environment you will be able to program faster.

Can you remember what each of the following does off the top of your head?  Write what each does.

pwd - print working directory

ls - list directory

mv - move a file or directory

cd - change directory

../ - move up in the tree and path

touch - makes an empty file

mkdir - make directory

less - page through a file

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove a file or empty directory

help - there is no help for mac users?  it is man for mac users and help for windows users but this lets you use the manual to find how to do something
