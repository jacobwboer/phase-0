# 1.1 Think About Time

This week I watched the Tedx Fremont talk about “Tiny Habits” or “Health and Habit” with BJ Fogg.  I googled him and he is a behavior scientist and professor at Stanford University.

He gave the formula of B=MAT.  Meaning that behavior has three elements: motivation, ability, and a trigger.  He asserted that people do not need to train themselves how to do something.  They need to train themselves how to make doing something automatic.  Another phrasing of this given in the talk is that people need to design for the behaviors that lead to the desired outcome, not for the outcome itself.  His method involved finding easy things to do that don’t require much motivation that can incrementally automate you to reach your goals.  He gave the example of doing several pushups after every use of the bathroom to reach fitness goals.  He also emphasized the need to celebrate small victories to positively reinforce oneself.

Timeboxing is an agreed amount of time that a person or team will work towards a goal.  Rather than extending the amount of time (if it is needed) to reach the goal, work is instead stopped and evaluated based on the amount of time taken.

Currently, I feel like I manage my time well.  I probably put more time into assignments and projects than others because I enjoy learning and challenging myself, but I also do not have a family or a job at this time.  Currently my strategy for time management work fine, because I do what I want whenever I want to for as long as is needed.  However, I am aware enough to realize this is most likely the complete opposite of what time management should be as I will have to someday balance a professional career, home, and social life.

At present, I go to work every day to my father’s office building and he has a spare desk at work that I can use.  I intend to treat Phase 0 like a normal 9-5 job.  Each week’s assignments and challenges will be my first priority for the day, and if times allows after their completion, I intend to study and explore additional coding related materials online.
